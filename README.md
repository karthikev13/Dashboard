# Dashboard

Purpose:
League of Legends is a popular MOBA video game played globally on a professional level. The dataset I chose (from Kaggle) is compiled data from 2017-2024 of competitive ranked games by professionals. 
The point of this dashboard was to visualize the heros that professionals play and compare how they fare against other heros. 

Results and Takeaways: 
By far, the strongest matchup was when players played the hero "Aatrox" against the hero "Xin Zhao". In these matchups, Aatrox won on average 13 games. However, its worth to note that this game had the most avg minutes played
(802 minutes) meaning other matchups did not have the same amount of time to compare with. All together, this visualization was helpful to see which matchups scale well. Future steps could be to scale this graph to the entire character roster(133 characters) as well as by rank, as this was only the top professionals of the gamer base. 

What I learned: 
This was my first experience with creating a dashboard with jupyter and python. I learned how to use Dash, and as well developed on my python skills a lot more. In particular, I learned how to create contingency tables which is an interesting way to visualize data. It was fun to learn how to integrate these tables with a front end view in Dash.
